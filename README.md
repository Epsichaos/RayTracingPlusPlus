# RayTracingPlusPlus
*The soft story of the implementation of a RayTracer in C++*

## Aim of the project

The aim of this project is to realise a renderer of simple images, based on the raytracing algorithm. This project will be written in C++ and will allow the user to use simple files to describe the scene he wants to render.

## Current development phasis

At the moment, the project is under development and the code cannot be use.
